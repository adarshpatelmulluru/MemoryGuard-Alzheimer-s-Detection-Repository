# MemoryGuard-Alzheimer-s-Detection-Repository
Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our Alzheimer's detection model analyzes MRI images of the brain, accurately predicting the presence of Alzheimer's disease. Leveraging deep learning techniques, our system provides efficient and reliable diagnosis, aiding in early detection and intervention for improved patient outcomes.
